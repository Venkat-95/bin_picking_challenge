This repo hosts the codebase for my Master Thesis, The main goal is to identify the 
bin boxes and hands of the user and thereby draw relations between them i.e to know if the
user picked up something and use this knowledge to program an automation system that can be
used by a robot to replicate the tasks in the future.
